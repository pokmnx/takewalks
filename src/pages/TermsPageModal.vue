                    of the visit. This is particularly important for guests who have qualified for a reduction based on
                    age or student status. Students should bring a valid photo ID to every tour.</p>

                <p class="descr single"><b>REFUNDS ON UNUSED SERVICES</b></p>
                <p class="descr single">All Takewalks.com tours are sold as an entire package; as such there will be no
                    offers of partial refunds for portions of a service that a guest has decided not to utilize. If a
                    guest has pre-purchased tickets to any sites visited, or tours or site visits similar to the tour
                    booked from an outside vendor, the company is not responsible/liable for the reimbursement or

                    cancellations and delays due to unforeseen circumstances, or those beyond all control (e.g.
                    inclement weather, strikes, seismic events). It is also recommended guests arrange medical and
                    personal insurance to cover any medical expenses, loss of baggage, loss of personal belongings, or
                    other such travel mishaps. Guests agree both the company and any local partner operators are not
                    liable for any of such unforeseen circumstances, and hold both parties harmless. All claims to
                    reimbursements for insurance must go directly through the insurance provider, and not through Walks
                    or its affiliates.</p>

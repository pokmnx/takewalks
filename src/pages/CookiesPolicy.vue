                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>

                <p>A cookie is a small data file, often including a unique identifier, which is sent to your computer, mobile phone or tablet device (referred to in this policy as a “device”) by the web server so the website can remember some information about your browsing activity on the website. The cookie will collect information relating to your use of our Services, information about your device, e.g. the device’s IP address and browser type, broad location and, if you arrived at our site via a link from third party site, the URL of the linking page.</p>

                <p>Similar technologies known as “local storage” may also be used in our Services as an alternative to cookies. This is technology which is similar to cookies and performs very similar functions, such as caching data to enable us to improve our Services, allowing you to register for our Services, tracking activity to enable us and our advertisers to advertise to you in accordance with this policy and counting the number of people who view adverts on our Services. Where we refer to “cookies” in this policy, we mean cookies or similar technologies.</p>

                <p>Cookies record information about your online preferences and help us to tailor our Services to your interests. Information provided by cookies can help us to analyze your use of our Services and help us to provide you with a better user experience.</p>

                <p>In addition to cookies, our Services may also use web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs. These are all types of technology implemented by websites or third party ad servers to allow them to analyze your website use and help improve your experience of the Services.</p>

                <h3>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COOKIES?</h3>

                <p>Session cookies are only stored for the duration of your visit to a website and are deleted from your device when you close your browser;
                Persistent cookies are saved on your device for a fixed period of time after the browser has closed and are used where we (or a third party) need to identify you for a later browsing session. The fixed period of time is typically 30-90 days for targeting or behavioral advertising cookies and may be up to 26 months for analytical performance and measurement cookies;
                First party cookies are set by the website you are visiting; and
                Third party cookies are cookies used within our Services which are set by other organizations. These include cookies from external analytics services which help us to understand the use of our sites, or by advertisers so that they can track the effectiveness of their advertisements.
                What are cookies used for?</p>

                <p><b>1. Functional Cookies</b><br>
                Functional cookies are essential to the running of our Services. They are used to remember your preferences on our websites and to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information collected by these cookies is usually anonymized, so we cannot identify you personally. Functional cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which could be used for selling advertising, but they do help with serving advertising. These cookies are usually session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session.</p>

                <p><b>2. Essential or ‘Strictly Necessary’ Cookies</b><br>
                These cookies are essential for the running of our Services. Without these cookies, parts of our websites would not function. These cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do remember preferences beyond your current visit and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes. These cookies are usually session cookies which will expire when you close your browsing session.</p>

                <p><b>3. Analytical Performance and Measurement Cookies</b><br>
                Analytical performance cookies are used to monitor the performance of our Services, for example, to determine the number of page-views and the number of unique users a website has. Web analytics services may be designed and operated by third parties. The information provided by these cookies allows us to analyze patterns of user behavior and we use that information to enhance user experience or identify areas of the website which may require maintenance. The information is anonymous (i.e. it cannot be used to identify you and does not contain personal information such as your name and email address) and it is only used for statistical purposes</p>

                <p><b>4. Targeting or ‘Behavioral Advertising’ Cookies</b><br>
                These cookies, which may be placed on your device by us or our trusted third party service providers, remember that you have visited a website and use that information to provide you with content or advertising which is tailored to your interests. This is often called online behavioral advertising (OBA) and is done by grouping together shared interests based upon web browsing history. Your web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (e.g. your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you. Without these cookies, content and advertisements you encounter may be less relevant to you and your interests. If you would like more information about OBA, including how to opt-out of these cookies, please visit: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" >http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> or scroll down to: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</p>

                <h3>HOW DOES TAKEWALKS USE COOKIES?</h3>
                <p>TakeWalks, together with our trusted partners, uses cookies in combination with other information we maintain for a number of purposes, including the following:</p>

                <p><b>1. Essential and Functional Cookies</b><br>
                We use these cookies to enable certain online functionality including:</p>

                <p>access your information so we can provide you with customized content and experiences, or remember the last page you visited on the Services;<br>
                identify returning users, registrants and subscribers and allow them to be presented with a personalized version of the site;<br>
                eliminating the need for returning users to re-enter their login details;<br>
                commenting on our sites;<br>
                maintain your settings and authenticate your identity while you are logged in to the Services;<br>
                to support security measures and to assist in identifying possible fraudulent or abusive activities. <br>
                If you object to the use of essential and functional cookies please scroll down to: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</p>

                <p><b>2. Analytical Performance and Measurement Cookies</b> <br>

                We use these cookies to measure users’ behavior to better develop our Services. By using analytics services provided by third parties such as Google Analytics, we can analyze and measure which pages are viewed and how long for and which links are followed, and we can use this information to provide more content which is of interest. We also use this analysis to report on our performance and to sell advertising. </p>

                <p>If you object to the use of analytical performance and measurement cookies please see: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</p>

                <p><b>3. Targeting and Behavioral Advertising Cookies</b> <br>

                We use these cookies to: <br>

                manage online advertising and revenue share arrangements. Our approved advertising partners, primarily Google (Doubleclick, AdSense), use cookies together with web beacons to provide advertising to you and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers by, for example, tracking how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement or followed a link in an advertisement; <br>
                manage eCommerce activities via affiliate links and associated revenue share arrangements;
                measure general user behavior across our sites and third party sites to build a profile based on users browsing patterns so that we and third parties can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to users’ interests. This means that if, for example, users visit a page with a review about a particular camera then the cookie will collect this information and we may target adverts for that camera to those users and, if users visit third party sites that are part of the same advertising network, those third parties may target adverts for that camera to those users; <br>
                to create profiles that trusted third parties can buy to allow them to better target their advertising with more relevant content; and
                keep track of the number of users who saw a particular ad or visited a particular page of one of our websites, analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and provide auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.
                The trusted partners we work with in relation to targeting and behavioral advertising include third-party ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, providers of advertisement content, research firms and other companies that help us provide more effective advertising and offer you a more personalized experience. As your browser, app or device communicates with the third party’s servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their web page or used their apps directly.
                We cannot control nor do we have access to any cookies placed on your computer by third party advertisers and sponsors. </p>

                <p>If you object to the use of targeting and behavioral advertising cookies please scroll down to: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</p>

                <p><b>4. Other Third Party Cookies</b> <br>

                You may notice on some pages of our websites that cookies have been set that are not related to TakeWalks. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook, these third party service providers may set their own cookies on your device. TakeWalks does not control the use of these third party cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them. Please check the third party websites for more information about these cookies.</p>


                <p>We also include web beacons in our emails to track the success of our marketing campaigns. This means that if you open an email from us we can see which of the pages of our Website you have visited. Our web beacons do not store additional information on your device but, by communicating with our cookies on your device, they can tell us when you have opened our email.</p>

                <p>If you object to the use of web beacons please scroll down to: How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</p>

                <p><b>How can users manage or opt out of cookies?</b><br>

If you would prefer to opt out of cookies, it is possible to control cookies by following the steps below, however you should be aware that you might lose some features and functionality of the website if you do so.</p>
